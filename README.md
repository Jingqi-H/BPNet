## Introduction
This repository is build for the proposed Bidirectional Pyramid Networks (BPNet), which contains full training and testing code on several segmentation datasets.

## Usage
1. Requirement:

   - Hardware: tested with RTX 2080 TI (11G).

   - Software: tested with PyTorch 1.2.0, Python3.7, CUDA 10.0, tensorboardX, Ninja, tqdm, Easydict
   
   - Anaconda is strongly recommended


2. Clone the repository:
<pre> 
   git clone https://github.com/ginobilinie/BPNet.git 
</pre>

3. How to Train
   - create the config file of dataset:train.txt, val.txt, test.txt
   
   file structureï¼š(split with tab)
   <pre>
   path-of-the-image   path-of-the-groundtruth
   </pre>
   
   - modify the config.py according to your requirements
   
   - train a network:
<pre>
   export NGPUS=8
   python -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=$NGPUS train.py  
</pre>

4. Test

   - inference
   <pre>
     python eval -e epoch_idx -d device_idx [--verbose ] [--show_image] [--save_path Pred_Save_Path]

   </pre>

5. Visualization

6. Other Resources

   Resources: GoogleDrive [LINK]() contains pretrained models and some share models.
